# EDA-Capstone-Project

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data . This data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services, and much more.

I am going to analyze the complete data of AirBnb. For this analysis, I used 1 CSV file in which there are 16 columns and 49000 rows and this data are mixed between categorical and numeric data.
The different problems for which we analyzed the data are:

1] What are the unique values for room and neighbourhood_group?

2] Which are the top 10 apartments/houses on the list?

3] Which are the top 10 private and shared rooms?

4] What is the average room rent for the locality?

5] Which are the top 20 most expensive localities in Airbnb listings?

6] Which are the least expensive neighborhoods according to Airbnb listings?

7] In which city most and least number of locality listed?

8] What is the review score for different locations?

For the visualization, I used Bar charts because Bar charts are basically used for the categorical data and most of the data in the dataset are categorical.
