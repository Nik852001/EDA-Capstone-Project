# EDA-Capstone-Project

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

I am goning to analyised the complete data of AirBnb. For this analysis I am used 1 csv file in which there are 16 columns and 49000 rows and this data are mixed between categorical and numeric data.
The different problem for which we analysied the data are:

1] What are unique values for room and neighbourhood_group?

2] Which are the top 10 apartment/houses in the list?

3] Which are the top 10 private and shared room?

4] What is average room rent for the locality?

5] Which are the top 20 most expensive locality in Airbnb listing?

6] Which are the least expensive neighbourhood according to Airbnb listing?

7] In which city most number of and least number of locality listed?

8] What is the review score for different location?

For the visulaization I am used Bar charts because Bar charts are basically used for the categorical data and most of the data in the dataset are the categorical.
